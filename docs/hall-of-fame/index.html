        <h1 class="title is-2">Jonathan Noble</h1>
        <p>Jonathan started his career in IT early, being kept out of primary school assemblies in order to show teachers how 
            to use BBC Model Bs. After watching Top Gun too many times, and a less than fun part-time job in PC World, he 
            nearly gave up computing and became a fighter pilot, but was somehow drawn back to the keyboard and has spent the last 
            decade managing Windows systems at Newcastle University. His primary focus is management and automation around Windows 
            Server products, Active Directory and Exchange; mainly using PowerShell. A blogger for many years and Twitter addict, 
            Jonathan became an active member of the PowerShell community from early in its life and received Microsoft MVP awards in 
            July 2009 and January 2012. He is also a member of the TechNet UK Community Council. When he's not writing PowerShell 
            scripts, he's a massive fan of basketball; both the NBA and the Newcastle Eagles.

            the North East Chambers of Commerce. Ben has not been officially involved in the IT Pro community before but is
