                            <p>This month we have two awesome talks for you.</p>
<h2>More Testable Code with the Hexagonal Architecture</h2>
<p>Hexagonal Architecture provides a set of simple and specific rules to organize your system's code. These rules make it easier to test your code, as well as
being a good fit for incorporating Domain-Driven Design. In this talk, we'll look at how Hexagonal Architecture differs from typical architectures. We'll
then dive into how Hexagonal Architecture leverages the idea of Separation of Concerns to make testing easier. We'll see how the architecture uses Ports &amp;
Adapters (another name for this architecture) to improve the design by clearly defining how external resources connect to the core of our application's logic.</p>
<h3>Ted M. Young</h3>
<p>Ted M. Young (known as JitterTed on social media) is a Java trainer, coding coach, speaker, and author. He's been in software development for over 30 years,
doing eXtreme Programming since 2000. Ted has worked for eBay, Google, Apple, and Guidewire Software. He is now an independent educator, helping those new to
the industry and experienced folks increase their joy in coding by making code more testable. Ted's favorite techniques are test-driven development, refactoring,
domain-driven design, and Hexagonal Architecture.</p>

<h2>Event Sourcing and CQRS on Azure Functions</h2>
<p>In this talk I outline a system built using Azure serverless functions and event grid, the CQRS architecture and with the underlying entity storage being
by event sourcing. The prototype shows how this allows you to assemble a highly performant, geographically distributed system which scales up and down rapidly for
an extremely small cost.</p>
<p>CQRS is an application design pattern (or architecture) that differs from single model architectures (like MVC or MVVM) in that the parts of the system responsible
for changing the state of the system (the Command side) is entirely separate to the parts of the system responsible for getting the state of the system (the Query side).</p>
<p>Event Sourcing is a data architecture that flips the way we store data on its head. Instead of storing the state of any given object as it currently is and
updating that state, we instead store the complete history of every change that has occurred to the object and allow us to derive the state of the object by
running code known as a projection over that event history.</p>
<p>Azure Event Grid is a set of connected technologies provided by Microsoft as part of their Azure cloud which are designed to facilitate an event-driven
architecture. It consists of event triggers that can be set up to either fire on a state change event and these triggers are linked by the Event Grid to
route the events from their trigger to a destination - and azure serverless function.</p>
<h3>Duncan Jones</h3>
<p>A .NET developer with a background in the financial services industry. He has a personal interest in highly scalable systems, which has lead to Event
Sourcing (by way of CQRS), and has developed a Visual Studio plug-in to for creating CQRS and Event Sourcing based systems via a visual interface.</p>
