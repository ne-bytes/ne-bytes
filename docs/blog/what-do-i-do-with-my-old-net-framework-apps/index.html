### What do I do with my old .NET Framework Apps?

Do you have some old apps lying around that you have to maintain? Do you long for a world where you could easily 
use the latest innovations with .NET as part of your code-base. In this session we will have an honest conversation 
about what we should be aware of when it comes to migration. We will take a look at what can be done with tools, 
like the new .NET Upgrade Assistant or Porting Assistant for .NET from AWS, which will walk you through the process 
of upgrading your legacy applications to the latest and greatest of .NET. Take full advantage of the latest .NET and 
C# features which foster better collaboration and developer productivity.

Bring your old apps and let's see what we can accomplish with them using the new .NET Upgrade Assistant and Porting 
Assistant for .NET from AWS
