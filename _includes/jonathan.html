        Jonathan started his career in IT early, being kept out of primary school assemblies in order 
        to show teachers how to use BBC Model Bs. After watching Top Gun too many times, and a less than 
        fun part-time job in PC World, he nearly gave up computing and became a fighter pilot, but was 
        somehow drawn back to the keyboard and has spent the last decade managing Windows systems at 
        Newcastle University. His primary focus is management and automation around Windows Server products, Active 
        Directory and Exchange; mainly using PowerShell. A blogger for many years and Twitter addict, Jonathan 
        became an active member of the PowerShell community from early in its life and received Microsoft MVP 
        awards in July 2009 and January 2012. He is also a member of the TechNet UK Community Council. When 
        he's not writing PowerShell scripts, he's a massive fan of basketball; both the NBA and the Newcastle Eagles.
