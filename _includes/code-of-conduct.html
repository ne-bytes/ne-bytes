<p>With thanks to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/pages/12061872/Code_of_Conduct/">Portland Python User Group</a>.</p>

<p>NE Bytes is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or 
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious 
beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be 
sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the NE Bytes organizers.</p>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual 
orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate 
intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or 
other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not 
appropriate for any NE Bytes event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior 
are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the NE Bytes organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, 
including warning the offender, expulsion from the NE Bytes community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone 
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an NE Bytes organizer immediately, or as soon as you 
feel comfortable doing so.</p>

<p><em>If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct please contact one of the organizers.</em></p>
