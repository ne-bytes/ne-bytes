# About
North East Bytes (NEBytes) is a User Group covering the North East and Cumbrian regions of the United Kingdom.  We have technical meetings covering Development and IT Pro topics every month.

Meeting Format

We meet on the third Wednesday of every month except in December where we meet on the second Wednesday.  Each meeting consists of two excellent one hour long sessions from a stellar line up of speakers from the UK, Europe and beyond.  One session will cover a Development topic and the second an IT Pro topic.  In between there is a half an hour break for food, refreshments and time for you to chat with the other attendees.  Invariably we also follow the meeting with a drink in a local pub.

Meeting Location

Meetings are held at Campus North http://campusnorth.co.uk/. You can find directions here https://goo.gl/maps/gJglS.

Occasionally, meetings are held at Newcastle University.  We are very grateful to the University for providing this facility to us.  http://www.ncl.ac.uk/travel/maps/navigator.php?type=&bldg=16&go.x=12&go.y=10

What Does it Cost?

Nothing, Zilch, Nada!  All of our meetings are free to attend, we donâ€™t intend to charge for any of our meetings.  We provide our time for organising and arranging our events.  Speakers kindly offer their time for free.

We provide cold refreshments free of charge however we do operate an honesty/donation box whereby if you wish to partake in hot food (pizza etc), please put a small donation in the box at the beginning of the meeting to help us to cover the costs of the purchase of the food.  Any monies left over from this at the end of the year are used to provide giveaways and prizes for the group for the following year.

Who are North East Bytes?

North East Bytes was co-founded by Andrew Westgarth, Jonathan Noble, Damien Foggon and Ben Lee in late 2009.  They wanted to create a group which catered for Developers and IT Pros in the region and there key aim was to provide the group for free.

Jonathan Noble

jon[1]Jonathan started his career in IT early, being kept out of primary school assemblies in order to show teachers how to use BBC Model Bs. After watching Top Gun too many times, and a less than fun part-time job in PC World, he nearly gave up computing and became a fighter pilot, but was somehow drawn back to the keyboard and has spent the last decade managing Windows systems at Newcastle University. His primary focus is management and automation around Windows Server products, Active Directory and Exchange; mainly using PowerShell. A blogger for many years and Twitter addict, Jonathan became an active member of the PowerShell community from early in its life and received Microsoft MVP awards in July 2009 and January 2012. He is also a member of the TechNet UK Community Council. When he's not writing PowerShell scripts, he's a massive fan of basketball; both the NBA and the Newcastle Eagles.
