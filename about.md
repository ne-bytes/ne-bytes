# About

We are a User Group based in Newcastle, in the UK, covering the North East and Cumbrian regions. We host free technical meetings covering 
Software Development and IT Pro topics every month in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. No prior knowledge of any system or language 
is a requirement for participation.

## Virtual Meetings

At present, due to Covid, we are meeting entirely online using Microsoft Teams. We aim to provide one talk per month but the date of each meeting 
can be more flexible than when in person. We still aim to start meetings at 6:30 and run for 90+ minutes depending on questions from the audience.


## In Person Meetings

When allowed again, we meet on the third Wednesday of every month except in December where we meet on the second Wednesday.  Each meeting consists of one or two excellent one hour long sessions from a stellar line up of speakers from the UK, Europe and beyond. One session will cover a Development topic and the second an IT Pro topic.  In between there is a half an hour break for food, refreshments and time for you to chat with the other attendees. Invariably we also follow the meeting with a drink in a local pub.


## Meeting Location

Our meeting location is currently under review. 


## What Does it Cost?

Nothing, Zilch, Nada!  All of our meetings are free to attend, we donâ€™t intend to charge for any of our meetings. We provide our time for organising and arranging our events. Speakers kindly offer their time for free.

We are sponsored for in person events so are able to provide cold refreshments and hot food (pizza etc.) free of charge, thanks to the companies who provide financial backing to us. See our [sponsors page](/sponsors/index.html) for details.

NE Bytes was co-founded by Andrew Westgarth, Jonathan Noble, Damien Foggon and Ben Lee in late 2009. They wanted to create a group which catered for Developers and IT Pros in the region and there key aim was to provide the group for free.

In 2016, the some of original founders of the group "retired" and passed on organization to Damien, Derek Graham, and John. Later in 2021, they were joined by Brett Miller.
