Propose a talk

We are always open to new speakers and new topics for discussion and learning at NE Bytes. You don't need to be a professional speaker or an expert in a particular subject. 
If you are new to public speaking we can work with you before the event to make sure you do the best possible job.

Session lengths

We have a range of session lengths possible for our meetups.

Introduction a quick 5 minute slot to introduce yourself, a project you're working on, or an event.
Lightening Talk a 5-20 minute slot, ideal for introducing a new concept
Shared Session a 20-45 minute session taking up half of an evening. Perfect for covering a smaller topic without resorting to padding
Full-session Usually this takes up an entire evening and covers about 90 minutes of content with a break in the middle. Great for a deep dive into a topic.

As all our sessions are online for the present moment, we run all meetups as a Microsoft Teams meeting and share screens with slides, demos. as needed. If you need anything 
specific please let us know.
