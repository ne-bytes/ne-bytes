        <p>We have been a virtual group meeting through Microsoft Teams since the start of the 
            COVID-19 pandemic. We will remain virtual for the short-tem but regularly re-evaluate 
            with the hope of going back to in-person meet-ups soon. 
        </p>
        {# TODO - need to draw attention to this !#}
        <p>We need a new venue! If you can offer us space for one evening a month, please <a href="{{ meta.email }}">get in touch</a>.</p>

        {# TODO - need to draw attention to this !#}
        <p>We meet on the third Wednesday of every month except in December where we meet on the second Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Each meeting usually consists of two one hour long sessions from speakers from the UK, Europe and beyond. One session will 
        cover a Development topic and the second an IT Pro topic.</p>
        <p>In between, there is a 30 minute break for food, refreshments and time for you to chat with the other attendees.</p>

        <p>With thanks to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/pages/12061872/Code_of_Conduct/">Portland Python User Group</a></p>
        <p>NE Bytes is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual 
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of 
            community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of 
            the NE Bytes organizers.</p>
        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, 
            physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, 
            harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual 
            attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any NE Bytes event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop 
            any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
        <p>If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the NE Bytes organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the 
            offender, expulsion from the NE Bytes community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other 
            concerns, please contact an NE Bytes organizer immediately, or as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.</p>
        <p>If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct please contact one of the organizers.</p>
