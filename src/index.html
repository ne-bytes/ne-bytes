            We have been a virtual group meeting through Microsoft Teams since the start of the 
            COVID-19 pandemic. We will remain virtual for the short-tem but regularly re-evaluate 
            with the hope of going back to in-person meet-ups soon.

            <p>We meet on the third Wednesday of every month except in December where we meet on the second Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Each meeting usually consists of two one hour long sessions from speakers from the UK, Europe and beyond. One session will 
            cover a Development topic and the second an IT Pro topic. In between the talks, there is a 30 minute break for food, refreshments 
            and time for you to chat with the other attendees.</p>

            orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of
