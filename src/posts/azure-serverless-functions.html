We're back for a Christmas special with Christos Matskas from Microsoft. Note the date as 
it's not on our usual monthly schedule - but it is at the same venue!

Join Christos to learn what Azure Functions are and how to write them and deploy them using
the Portal, CLI tools, VS Code, Github and VSTS for proper CI/CD.

Azure Functions are the young and cool cousin to our battle tested and much loved WebJobs.
Azure Functions introduces an event driven, compute-on-demand experience that provides a radical
new approach on how you set up and run tasks. Where they truly shine is in the great
interoperability they provide with various services on and off the cloud, such as SaaS
products and on-premises systems.
