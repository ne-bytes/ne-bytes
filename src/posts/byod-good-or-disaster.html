Join North East Bytes for our seventh event of 2013 where we are delighted once again to partner 
with the SharePoint User Group. Following on from the great events that we've had over the 
last two years, we've lined up another great event for your benefit. We are really pleased to 
welcome Microsoft Most Valuable Professional John Timney and Brian English.


### Bring Your Own Device, or Bring Your Own Disaster with John Timney (Microsoft MVP)

How do you approach BYOD in a changing world where we are all expecting to access software like 
SharePoint from any device, any Operating System and from any location? This session considers 
some of the thinking and approach needed to introduce a BYOD strategy into your organisation to 
enable cohesive BYOD support coverage for SharePoint that could equally be applied to any 
software application. The session considers the evolving market, thoughts around cloud and 
commodity storage, what SharePoint as an application brings to the table, and how to approach 
formulating a SharePoint 2013 BYOD strategy to keep your organisation safe, satisfy the demands of 
end users, and understand the operational, compliance and people challenges emerging in an ever 
changing, rapidly evolving multi-device world.

John is a fifteen year veteran MVP, an international conference speaker, co-author of a number of 
books and an Administrator for the SharePoint User Group in the UK.
