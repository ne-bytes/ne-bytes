Developers can often be a little too keen to start cutting code, but we can save a lot of time and headaches if we do a 
little work up-front to clear the way. Jason discusses what he might do before he starts writing code to visualise high-level 
design, choose and prove a technical architecture, and get the delivery pipeline up and running so he can start delivering 
working software straight away.
