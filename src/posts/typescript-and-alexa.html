After a longer than anticipated break over the summer we're back with two talks in September. We're welcoming Peter Shaw 
for our first talk.


## Typescript for the C# Developer

There's little doubt that JavaScript is eating the world these days, everywhere you look it's JavaScript, 
from the server through to the browser.

The problem is, JavaScript is a nasty, horrible unforgiving language, not at all like our nice strongly typed 
safe languages, such as C# and others we use in the back-end and on the server.

Because of JavaScripts popularity, many of us that have spent most of our Careers in the world of C#, are finding 
that to stay current we have to make the move to front-end and the world of JavaScript.

Enter TypeScript. Typescript allows you to quickly get to grips with the world of JavaScript, while still retaining your 
knowledge, skills and most importantly Strongly Typed way of doing things, in this session I'll show you why as a 
C# developer you need to seriously consider using TypeScript, and what the language has to Offer over Regular JavaScript. Oh 
and I might even throw in a little bit of Aurelia along the way ;-)
