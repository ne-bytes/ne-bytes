We said we'd re-run a night of lightning talks like we did back in early 2017 so this month's meeting 
is it. It's lightning talk time!

We're looking for short, 5-15 minute talks on a technology-related topic. Slides or demo or live coding? A 
pet project you've been tinkering with, a new programming language, platform or framework?

Email events@nebytes.net or tweet us @NEBytes with your ideas.
