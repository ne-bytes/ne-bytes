Join North East Bytes for our tenth event of 2013, this time round we are 
pleased to be partnering SUGUK North East. After our hiyatus in September we have the pleasure 
of welcoming back Steve Smith who presented at our first ever NEBytes. We've given over both 
sessions to Steve with the aim of the evening being to provide everyone with information to help 
with your planning of a migration and upgrade to SharePoint 2013. Having the right information on 
how the new products differs to 2010 or 2007 is vital in preparing your test environments and planning 
for the actual production upgrade.


### Session 1 - Upgrading SharePoint 2010 Content Databases to SharePoint 2013

Anyone who has tried an upgrade from previous versions of SharePoint know how painful it can be 
if the right research is not done. In this session I will go through the options available, 
the hardware and software requirements and walk through a database upgrade to 2013.


### Session 2 - Scaling Search in SharePoint 2013

So now that we have upgraded our Farm let's look at one of the biggest architectural changes 
from one of the SharePoint 2010 Service applications and see how we scale search components in 
SharePoint 2013.

Steve Smith is the Director of Combined Knowledge, a specialist Sharepoint training consultancy. 
Steve is a Sharepoint MVP and a prominent and very well known circuit speaker for the Sharepoint User 
Group in the UK
