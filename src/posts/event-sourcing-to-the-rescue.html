Nowadays, information and data are the most valuable resources. The traditional way of overwriting the current state may not 
be enough anymore. During the webinar, I will show why Event Sourcing is a model that allows you not to lose any business 
data. I'll also show how to get insights based on that. I'll show practical examples using EventStoreDB and .NET.

## Oskar Dudycz

For over 14 years, I'm creating systems close to the business process. I started a career before StackOverflow existed 
(so over 14 years ago). I'm a developer, technical team leader, architect.

I'm an active open-source developer,  DevAdvocate at Event Store and one of the Marten library maintainers. My current 
biggest interest is Event Sourcing and Domain Driven Design. I'm trying to spread the good word about that and practically 
show how to do that every day.
