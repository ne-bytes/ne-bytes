Join North East Bytes for our third event of 2013. Following on from the great events that we've had over the 
last two years, we've lined up another great event for your benefit. We are really excited to welcome the local 
teams entering this year's Imagine Cup event and we'll also be taking a look at managing VMware with PowerShell.


### Imagine Cup North East teams

We are pleased to welcome the teams from Imagine Cup North East who have entered the Imagine Cup competition this 
year. Each team will be pitching their projects and their entries. Come along to support our local entrants and give 
them some real world feedback on their projects and solutions which they can then use to strengthen their 
entry into this year's competition with the eventual aim of winning the UK final and competing with the 
rest of the world at the world final in St. Petersburg, Russia!

This is a great opportunity for our community to support the students and future of our community!


### PowerCLI 101

IT Pros are starting to come to grips with the idea of managing Microsoft products with PowerShell, but it's not 
just Microsoft who are making use of the powerful automation capabilities on offer. VMware have been developing their 
own PowerShell-based management shell for some time - PowerCLI. In this session, Jonathan Medd, a Microsoft MVP 
for Windows PowerShell and VMware vEXPERT, will introduce PowerCLI and show you how to really take control of your 
virtual infrastructure.


### Location

The event will be hosted in Room 1.02 of Claremont Tower at Newcastle University. For a detailed campus
