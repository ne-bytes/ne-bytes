the last two years, we've lined up another great event for your benefit. We are really pleased to welcome 
Friends of NEBytes, Steve Spencer and Rik Hepworth from Black Marble.


### Web API, SignalR, Windows Azure and Gadgeteer - Challenges of the .Net Micro-Framework

that uses web api, signal R and Windows Azure.

### Give It a Kick: Lessons Learned from TFS 2012 Lab and SCVMM 2012

Black Marble recently migrated their TFS2010 Lab to TFS 2012 and thought it would be a good idea to move to a 
single SCVMM 2012 instance to manage both lab and production Hyper-V whilst also moving to SQL 2012 Always 
On and Server 2012 across the board. Find out just how much fun that was as Rik discusses the process.

Rik is the IT Director of Black Marble, a Microsoft Gold Partner based in the North of England. Black Marble 
specialises in Biztalk and SharePoint-based business automation. In addition to making sure Black Marble's own 
systems deliver, Rik leads the IT side of Black Marble's SharePoint practice. Rik has been delivering SharePoint 
solutions since Black Marbleâ€™s involvement in the beta of SharePoint 2007 and presents regularly for Black Marble 
and their partners on this and other topics.
