Feeling like we're nearly into summer yet?! Come along to this months NEBytes for some cool beer, a good talk and 
some tech chat...


## Demistifying Rx - Sam Hogarth

The Reactive Extensions (Rx) began as a Microsoft project and has grown into an open-source, multi-language set of 
libraries. Using Rx you can easily compose asynchronous, event-driven programs by building Observable streams and 
performing operations on those streams. If you're familiar with LINQ you're pretty much there. In this talk we'll 
take an introductory look into how Rx works, how you can build applications using Rx (including testing!) and take an 
in-depth look into how some of the key operations work using marble diagrams.


Sam Hogarth is a Senior Developer at Scott Logic, where he spends his time building web-based trading platforms using 
React. He has five years experience working across the investment banking and applied science sectors, developing for 
the web, desktop and mobile.

We don't have a fixed session for the second slot this month but will instead continue with Jon's Magical technology rating 
game that seemed to go down quite well a couple of months back.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
