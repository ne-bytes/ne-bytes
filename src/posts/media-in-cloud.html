content! Don't miss out register today!


### Desired State Configuration with PowerShell - Jonathan Noble

This October, when Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 hit the streets, theyâ€™re coming with 
Windows PowerShell version 4.0. The main reason for the major version number increment is the addition 
of Desired State Configuration (DSC). This new set of cmdlets and language extensions provide the ability 
to declaratively specify the configuration of your environment and maintain the desired state of your 
systems.

In this session, PowerShell MVP Jonathan Noble will be going into the detail of what DSC can do for 
you, showing how to define and deploy configuration scripts, as well as touching on some of the 
other new features of PowerShell 4.0.


### Powering Applications With Windows Azure Media Services - Andrew Westgarth

Windows Azure Media Services provide developers with a fantastic scalable solution to build cost 
effective media distributioon solutions with support for a wide variety of platforms (Flash, 
Android, iOS, Windows etc).

In this session we'll look at how you can get started with Windows Azure Media Services to build a 
full end to end experience, from ingest to consumption.
