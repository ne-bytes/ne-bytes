For our December event we've got Christos Matskas giving us a talk on the new kid on the block - .NET Core.

an Azure Dev Premier Field Engineer. Before joining Microsoft, he was a successful entrepreuner collaborating 
with companies such as MarkIT, Lockheed Martin and Barclays. He's been building software for over 12 years and 
he's a passionate Open Source advocate. He contibutes regularly to numerous OSS projects and works closely with 
the developer community to make the space bigger and better.

NET Core has been written from the ground up to be the best web development platform for Windows, Mac, and 
Linux. You can now use your favorite editor to create faster, leaner and more memory efficient NET applications 
that work everywhere. In this session, you'll get an introduction to the major advancements and an overview of 
what's changed in the new, brave world of .NET Core. You'll also get the chance to see how you can create ASP.NET 
Core apps that leverage all the new front-end tooling like npm, Bower, Grunt and Gulp to make development 
easier. This is going to be session full of demos and information that promises to rock your world!

We're aiming to have a second speaker confitmed shortly as well - check back for further details. As per usual 
there'll be networking over pizza during the sessioin break. Christmas jumper's optional!
