This month we have two talks for you, one from John Staveley and the other from Timothy Bishop. 


##Azure DevOps with John Staveley

In this talk John will show how Azure Devops can be used to automate the deployment and security checks of a 
website in the Azure cloud. In this talk we will go through how a variety of tools are used to gain security 
insights into your code and deployed environment. We will explore how this relates to the pull security left 
philosophy from DevSecOps. After the talk you will have gained a good insight into all the tools you can use 
to improve the security of your deployed code base.
