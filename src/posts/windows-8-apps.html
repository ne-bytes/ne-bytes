Join North East Bytes for our fifth event of 2013. Following on from the special events that we've had over 
the last two years, we've lined up another great event for your benefit. We are really excited to 
welcome back Gill Cleeren, Microsoft Regional Director and Silverlight MVP as he visits on his tour!!.


### Applied MVVM in Windows 8 Apps: Not Your Typical MVVM Session!

For some time now, the community has been touting the MVVM pattern as being the best way to build XAML-based 
applications. By now, you should be convinced that MVVM is really the way to go. But then, you start 
building a real-world Windows 8 application and you encounter all kinds of challenges you hadn’t thought 
about before. How do I properly structure an application? How do I implement navigation? How do I manage 
tiles or contracts from MVVM? How do I use Dependency injection correctly? And how do the new data controls 
in Windows 8 work in combination with MVVM?

A whole list of questions that this session will aim at answering!
