It's our 8th Birthday this month and in celebration we've lined up a double session with one of our original 
co-founders Andrew Westgarth! Looking forward to seeing you on the 17th!


## Deploy and Run Container Based Applications at Scale with App Service on Linux

Hosting more than 1 million cloud applications, Azure App Service helps developers quickly build, deploy and 
scale applications without having to maintain the underlying web servers or operating systems. Now we are 
excited to bring these proven capabilities to Linux developers lowering the barriers to entry for building container 
based web applications. Come to learn how to use App Service on Linux to deploy your container-based web applications 
to the cloud in seconds. We will also share how you can use the open source tools that you are already familiar 
with while leveraging the built-in CI/CD, auto scaling and Web SSH features from App Service on Linux. Bring your 
code or bring your container, we have a solution for you to increase your productivity and run your applications 
at scale easily.


## Azure Stack and Azure App Service, an overview for IT Professionals and Developers

What is Azure Stack? How does it offer customers and organizations a true Hybrid cloud? Add in Azure services such as 
Azure App Service and Azure Functions and using consistent tools and processes across public and hybrid cloud and 
developers suddenly have a highly productive platform on which to deliver applications and experiences. In this 
session I'll give an introduction and overview of Azure Stack and dive into how Azure App Service provides a 
consistent experience for developers wishing to deploy to the hybrid cloud, and I'll also show how an Azure Stack Cloud 
Admin can manage their Azure App Service Resource Provider deployment.
