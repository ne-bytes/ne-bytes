This week we are delighted to host Mike (GeePaw) Hill talking to us about change.

Change-harvesters say we can change systems most effectively when both the content and the 
approach of our change is human, local, oriented, taken, and iterative. We can apply these ideas to any 
change we undertake, but they're especially relevant when we're changing code. The most common answer 
a change-harvester will give to the question, "How can I get more value faster?" is this: "Take many 
more significantly smaller steps."  In this talk, we'll see why that recommendation is so effective.
