We're trying something a little different this month and we want you to be part of the event! It's lightning talk time!

We've already got a few talks lined up but we'd like to see more. After all the last thing you want is for Damien, Derek and John to waffle for two hours!

Do you have a topic close to your heart? A pearl of wisdom you'd like to share? If so come along and talk.

If you want to talk for 5 minutes then do so. 10? That's good as well. We'll have to draw the line somewhere but it's negotiable.
