After the Lightning Talks in May we're back with two full sessions in July. We're looking 
forward to seeing you all there.


## The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence

These days, artificial intelligence is always in the news and on technology roadmaps, yet the idea of it 
is older than modern computing. So why the increased interest in it? Why has it suddenly become the next 
big thing and how should we expect it to make decision making easier?

This session:

* starts by looking at the history of modern AI, back to when Alan Turing first dreamed of machines
* considers why new data storage and processor hardware technologies are letting it take off
* suggests how it might shape the future of business analytics and the world we live in

## Group vs Teams

Microsoft have provided some great tools to enable us to collaborate in Office 365. We can use 
calendars, files, distribution lists, Skype, files â€¦ the list keeps growing.

With the release of Teams, we have a new way to work with these different tools.

In this presentation I will compare and contrast the capabilities of Office 365 Groups and 
Teams, and even some of the capabilities found in more traditional SharePoint team sites.

You will learn what the differences are, what the benefits are and even what some of the teething 
pains are, and be enabled to choose the most appropriate tool for your teams to use.
