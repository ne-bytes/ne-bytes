Microsoft MVP Mike Stephenson joins us for the February meeting of NE Bytes.

Application Insights is one of the foundation monitoring and telemetry tools within the Azure space.  In this session we will look at the role App 
Insights plays for developing solutions with technologies like Azure Functions, Logic Apps, API Management and how you can leverage the data provided 
to help support and troubleshoot your applications built on Azure.
