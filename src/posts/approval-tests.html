This month, we are really pleased to have Emily Bache dialling in for a virtual session on Approval Testing. 

Many teams struggle with code they have inherited that has poor structure, lacks unit tests, and they feel afraid to 
change. Approval testing (also known as ‘Golden Master’ testing) is one of several techniques that’s often used to 
get this kind of code under control. The aim is to achieve high test coverage and high confidence with a 
minimum of test code to maintain afterwards. 

In this session we'll demonstrate the technique and discuss how it compares with other styles of unit testing.
