Continuing with our virtual sessions, this week we have Chris Wraith taking us through Kubernetes.

Kubernetes 101 is for engineers who either have a little Kubernetes experience or none at all. It introduces 
Kubernetes as a concept, why it is needed and how to get started. There is a demo showing how to create a cluster 
and deploy a workload.

This session is also useful for those who have used Kubernetes in anger but want its basic abstractions 
explained in more detail.
