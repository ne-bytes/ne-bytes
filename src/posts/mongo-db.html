This month we have Kevin Smith to talk about Mongo DB


## A more flexible way to store your data with MongoDB

If you've been anywhere near software development, the norm is to store your data in a relational form, but 
what if there was a different way?

We will take a look at the history of MongoDB and why it continues to be a trending database year on year. We 
will then go into the advantages of having a flexible document model and how we can utilize MongoDB for our 
application storage.
