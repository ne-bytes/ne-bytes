We're back from our long winter rest and pleased to have Sam Hogarth with us for our first event of 2023!

Developers have a **lot** to keep track of: technical details, domain concepts and the ever-shifting waves in our industry.

We can't keep this stuff purely in our heads. Yet we need access to our information at the speed of thought: just in time.

As knowledge workers our most valuable asset is our knowledge. Our effectiveness is driven by our ability to **apply** this knowledge.

So let's talk about taking **smart notes**, a suite of techniques to compound your thinking and get things done.

In this session we will cover:
    
* How to take effective notes
* How to organise your knowledge, organically and by actionability
* What tools exist in this space (we have come a long way since Notepad!)
* Building up a graph of knowledge through links
* Curating your own integrated thinking environment
