## Uno Pomodoro

Peter Bull will be joining us first for a short talk about Uno Platform.

## Lessons from my Journey to the Dark Side

Before a project happens, somebody has to pay for it. Usually that involves a sale. In this talk I'll be talking about what I have 
learned in my journey from software development to consultancy and sales. Firstly we'll consider and then demolish some stereotypes, 
talk about why sales is important to technical people and emphasise why everyone is a sales person sometimes before finally 
talking about dealing with customers.

### Dylan Hayes

I am a Microsoft 365 Consultant working at Blacklight Software, a Microsoft Gold Partner in Wakefield near Leeds. I'm also one of 
the organisers of the 'Microsoft 365 North' user group.  I came to the information technology profession via an long and interesting 
road, which left me with an abiding  passion for solving business problems with technology. Along the way I’ve worked with a lot 
of different technologies but right now I spend my days applying Microsoft platforms to customer challenges. When I’m not at work I 
enjoy being outdoors, and running long distances across wild places.
