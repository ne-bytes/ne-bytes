We have two speakers this month on two different topics.


## How to move from Manual Testing to Automated Testing with Postman

In this session, we'll first go through what Postman is and see how it's commonly being used. Then we'll jump 
into some demos to see how it can be used for more than single endpoint testing and for most steps of the 
development lifecycle. We'll also look at the different integrations available (from GitHub, to Azure API 
Management, to Datadog etc.). 

Unfortunately, our original speaker, Arlemi is not available but Ian has stepped in to take this place.

their collective knowledge, and am a strong champion of diversity in the tech industry. When I'm not 
working, I'm live-streaming about career advancement and interview preparation, tinkering with 3D printing or 
IoT projects, or telling dad jokes on Twitter.


## Microsoft & AI

Microsoft & AI discusses the latest innovations for how you can search with Microsoft Bing and what you can 
create with Microsoft Designer powered by AI and will show off some of the capabilities of these new innovations 
from Microsoft.
