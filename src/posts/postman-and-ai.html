We have two speakers this month on two different topics.

## How to move from Manual Testing to Automated Testing with Postman

In this session, we'll first go through what Postman is and see how it's commonly being used. Then we'll jump 
into some demos to see how it can be used for more than single endpoint testing and for most steps of the 
development lifecycle. We'll also look at the different integrations available (from GitHub, to Azure API 
Management, to Datadog etc.).

naturally turned to developer relations as a deep advocate for great user experiences and access to knowledge. 


## Microsoft & AI

Microsoft & AI discusses the latest innovations for how you can search with Microsoft Bing and what you can 
create with Microsoft Designer powered by AI and will show off some of the capabilities of these new innovations 
from Microsoft.
