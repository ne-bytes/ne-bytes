We are back with a new venue and a different format.


## Building mobile applications with PowerApps and Flow

PowerApps and Flow have been getting a lot of attention lately, but in this session we will take things a little bit further 
than introduction and build a real application that uses both services. This application should highlight the true capability of 
PowerApps and Flow, and also expose some of its (current) weaknesses.​

difficulties, we will be showing a recording of the session Mark had hoped to present to us live.


## Strangle Your Legacy Code

When you're mired in an ancient codebase that makes refactoring risky and expensive, how do you clear a path to 
continued delivery? According to the old saw, the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, and the next best time is 
today. But if you already have a gnarled old source tree, an old saw is the wrong tool. Instead, plant a Strangler: a 
pattern for preserving your software investment by arranging for new functionality to grow in a new codebase.

As a mob, we'll test-drive a Strangler, then test-drive new features into it. Don't know what to try next? Take the 
keyboard. Got an idea? Step away and talk someone else through it. You'll leave with a powerful strategy for extending 
the useful life of working, valuable software -- _especially_ when it's hard to change. We'll also send you home with a 
free bonus development practice to accelerate your team's learning. For a limited time only!
