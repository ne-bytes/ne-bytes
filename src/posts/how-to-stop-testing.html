Do you code on your own? When you do, do you write unit tests? Do you agree that there are benefits to using test-driven development?

My testing strategy was getting lax on a small personal coding project. I stopped testing for bad reasons, but started again 
for good ones. The experience allows me to demonstrate in practice the impact it can have on your code base when you don’t test, and 
also when you do. This talk, based on simple practical examples, will explain exactly why unit tests, a TDD approach and 
pairing can make all the difference to your code.
