After a hiatus that took longer than we'd intended we're back with our November event. As 
usual we're at Campus North but we've got a change of date - it's a Thursday this month rather 
then the usual Wednesday.


## Building Realtime apps with RethinkDB and Node.JS - Matt Collins

In todays online world, user experience is key. Users expect slick interfaces that are intuitive, 
informative and engaging. More and more, building apps that update the user in Realtime are becoming an 
essential part of this experience - and we can see this every day with things like Google Docs, 
Facebook Notifications, Slack and BBC Live Text.

RethinkDB is a fully featured, opensource, NoSQL database designed to make developing for the 
Realtime Web easy. We'll talk about changefeeds, clustering and how combining with Node.js can help you 
avoid some of the pitfalls of building rich, engaging, Realtime Apps to scale and across multiple platforms.

By the end of this talk you be ready to go back to the office and create your first Realtime App with 
RethinkDB and Node.
