## Azure DevTest Labs

Azure DevTest Labs is a service that helps you quickly create environments in Azure while minimizing waste and 
controlling cost. You can test the latest version of your application by quickly provisioning environments using 
reusable templates and artifacts, easily integrate it with your deployment pipeline, or create pre-provisioned 
environments for training and demos.

In this talk, Darren will cover his team's implementation of Azure Dev Test Labs, some of the good, the bad and 
the ugly of the solution and some really nice features that can save both Devs and QAs time.


### Darren Tingle

I am a Senior QA Engineer at Sage, have tried my hand at Dev, DevOps and Support in previous guises. Provided several 
workarounds to Microsoft regarding issues with Azure over the years and some more specifically regarding Azure 
DevTest Labs. Outside of work I’m trying to learn how to make better videos and fly steadier with my Drone, have a 
love hate relationship with NUFC and I’m a massive Pink Floyd fan.


## SharePoint Hub Sites Deep Dive

SharePoint hub site are a relatively new part of the SharePoint online modern user experience. Hub sites offer a way to tie 
together collections of related modern site with common branding and navigation. Traditionally producing richly featured 
SharePoint intranets has required either custom coding or the use of an intranet in a box product, but hub sites offer the 
tantalising prospect of this being ‘out of the box’. The session will explore what hub sites can do for you now, and are 
likely to do in the near future, and offer guidance based on developing real customer sites based on our own experiences 
during the first year of hub sites being in General Availability.


### Dylan Hayes

I am employed as a Tech Lead specialising in Office 365 by Blacklight Software, a IT company in Wakefield near Leeds. I came 
to the information technology profession via an long and interesting road, which left me with a passion for solving business 
problems with technology. Along the way I’ve worked with a lot of different technologies but right now I spend my days applying 
SharePoint and Office 365 to customer challenges. When I’m not at work I enjoy being outdoors, and am a keen if not especially 
fast runner. Feel free to ask me about my Friday commute.
