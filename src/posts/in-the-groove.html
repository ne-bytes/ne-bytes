For our second meeting of 2016, NEBytes welcomes back Peter Bull, and new speaker Jon Bulmer.

## In the Groove - Developing with Groove Music - Peter Bull

Groove Music is the music platform from Microsoft available on desktop, tablet, phone, console and 
web but also features a powerful and free to use API for developers.

Windows 10 and .NET Developer, Peter Bull, will go through how to use the Groove Music API and .NET 
SDK and share his experiences of developing using Groove Music in his own application for Windows 10, 
TuneCardr.


## Fogbugz integration with Kiln - Jon Bulmer

I am active participant of NEBytes and DDD North. I am a senior developer at a national company based in 
Teesside, I work with Code Club helping with the development of young talent coming out of our schools. This 
will be my first demonstration of a product aimed at helping the software developer. I have worked with 
Fogbugz and Kiln for a few years now and find it helpful with the management of projects.In the team 
environment and working on my personal projects.

I will be demonstrating how I set up milestones for an objective in a project, that can be sliced up 
into tasks divided up in a team. Set time scales and review the outcomes of development that can bring 
the teams work together, ready for a deadline agreed in the milestone. This can and does work with 
multiple developers working with the same file or files independently.

See you all there!
