After a brief hiatus we're back in February. And we're also back at Campus North. We've got two talks 
for you this month.

## Building your own Private Cloud on a Shoe String

This month, we have a talk by Mark Thompson from Global Data Sentinel... During this talk I will offer an 
alternative to AWS and Azure, a little known provider that also happens to have the third most hosting 
servers in the world (According to Netcraft 2015).

What if I also said this company was also was often much cheaper than Azure or AWS while offering similar 
SLAâ€™s? What about an easy to use REST API that covers pretty much everything they do? Interested yet? 
I was. The company is called OVH.

I will discuss the benefits and limitations of using OVH to build a cloud infrastructure. Discussions and 
Demonstrations will include:

* Virtual Instances on the OVH Public Cloud
* Dedicated Servers
* Setting up Microsoft Hyper-V Core on Dedicated Hardware
* Microsoft System Centre Virtual Machine Manager
* Firewalls and Load Balancers
* Private Networking and World Wide Data Centres
* Using Object Storage with Open Stack and C#
* Git, Gulp, Grunt, Node and Code: Making Sense of the Modern Development Toolchain

Our second talk is from Dr Bill Ayers... JavaScript was once just a scripting tool for "front-end" developers. 
Now it's gone mainstream. And along with it comes a new set of tools that the cool kids use. In this session 
I'm going to look at some of the new tooling that is being used by web and open-source developers and increasingly 
in enterprise development and by engineers at Microsoft building the next generation of SharePoint and Office 365 
technologies and the SharePoint Framework. We'll look at the tools, when you would use them, and how they 
relate to more traditional IDEs like Visual Studio. We'll also look at JavaScript as a language, including its 
shortcomings, and how it is changing, along with the role of transpilers like TypeScript. If you are planning to 
build solutions for Office 365 and SharePoint over the next few years, you need to get up to speed on the modern 
development toolchain.
