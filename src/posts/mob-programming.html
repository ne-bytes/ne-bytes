This month the Agile North East user group have Woody Zuill over visiting from the USA talking about 
"Mob Programing". So instead of having our usual dual event this month we're keeping the airwaves 
clear (and extending the summer break!) and suggest you head along to see him in action...

Woody has an impressive track record working with the likes of Ericsson, Schneider Electric, Qualcomm, 
Intel, H & M, King Games, Capital One, Twitter, Zip Car, Pivotal Labs, and Spotify.

Mob Programming is a development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same 
time, in the same space, and on the same computer. It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work 
the team does including designing, coding, testing, and working with the customers, users and other 
stakeholders. This is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming, and accentuates face-to-face 
communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile approach to 
software development. Mob Programming can be a highly effective approach to software development.
