Tools for Power users who want to build no-code solutions offer real value to business who want to build useful business 
applications without the need for hardcore developers. But don't be fooled by the marketing, demonstrators or "so simple 
your Mum could do it" claims some would have you believe; in the real world things are more complex and production quality 
Flows and business solutions need to be developed for that real world.

Everyone involved needs a realistic understanding of what that does to the development effort, irrespective of whether it 
is a professional developer or an engaged power user. This session will look at rebuilding a Microsoft Flow to
