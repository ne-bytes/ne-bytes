Join North East Bytes for our eighth event of 2013. Following on from the great events that we've 
had over the last two years, we've lined up another great event for your benefit. We will be 
having our very own Tech Ed 2013 and //Build 2013 retrospective event here in Newcastle.


### The Best of Tech Ed US/Europe and //Build 2013

NEBytes' very own Andrew Westgarth, Jonathan Noble, Ben Lee and Damien Foggon will be 
taking a retrospective look at announcements made at Tech Ed US/Europe and //Build 2013.

We'll be taking a look at new developments in both in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 
R2, new capabilities in Visual Studio 2013 and lots of other items which have not even been 
announced yet (Fingers crossed for more new stuff at Tech Ed Europe and //Build ;-)).

We'll keep updating this listing with more details as we get closer to the event.


### Location

The event will be hosted in Room 1.02 of Claremont Tower at Newcastle University. For a detailed campus
